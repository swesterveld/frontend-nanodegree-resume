# frontend-nanodegree-resume

This code is the result I achieved for ***[Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) - Project 2: Interactive Resume***.

This code has been *reviewed by me*. According to me, based on the rubric used
by the Udacity reviewer, this code at least meets specifications on all the
criteria.

A list of websites, books, forums, blog posts, Github repositories etcetera
that I have referred to or used in this submission can be found in the

file.

## Interactive Resume
This code is a fork of the [frontend-nanodegree-resume](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume)
repository provided by Udacity. Some additional things I've implemented in this
project are:
* A visualization of my skills in a word-cloud ([d3-cloud](https://github.com/jasondavies/d3-cloud))
constructed as an SVG, by making use of the D3.js library.
* Internship-objects in a separate attribute of the work-object, to show
  (and mark as such) in the 'Work Experience' section.
* Certifications in a separate array of the education-object, to show in the
  section about education.

## GitHub Pages
The resume is hosted on GitHub Pages. If you're interested in the
